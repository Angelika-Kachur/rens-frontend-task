## Implementation

I decided to create a project with vue CLI and routes, and I made different Components because I guess it is what you do on real projects.
Also, I made small details like favicon and example with shop page with products there, 
It was very interesting and now I'm sure that Vue is awesome, so thank you for it :)

There are two commands to start the project:
- npm run serve (dev version)
- npm run build (dist  )

If you have any questions, just write to me
